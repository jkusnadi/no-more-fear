#initialize a repo with
git init

#after adding a few files and committing each time you can reset to a particular commit

#find the commit ID's
git reflog

git reset --hard c3aa8bf
#note: even after a reset, you can go back to a previous commits if needed. Git does not remove files very easily

#'git revert' surgically removes things that happened in a particular commit. so if you revert the third commit, the third file is gone but the fourth one is kept
git revert 525ecb1
#Note: if you are stuck on a VI editor, type :q to get out

#cherry-pick is the opposite of revert. It brings back a file done in a commit
git cherry-pick 525ecb1

#upload files to newly created (empty) GitHub repository
#renames master to main
git branch -M main 

git remote add GitHub https://github.com/jkusnadi/no-more-fear.git
git push -u GitHub main
